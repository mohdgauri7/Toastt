 * Declares a method capable of handling a drawable attribute. If the Spyglass framework finds a {@code Drawable} value

 * applied to methods which satisfy all of the following criteria:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The method is a non-static member of an Android View subclass.</li>
 * <li>The method has no other handler annotations.</li>
 * <li>The method has at least one {@code Drawable} parameter.</li>
 * <li>Except for one {@code Drawable} parameter, every parameter belonging to the method has a placeholder annotation.</li>
